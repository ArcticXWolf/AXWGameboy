# AXWGameboy

You can try the emulator in your browser here: [https://arcticxwolf.github.io/AXWGameboy/](https://arcticxwolf.github.io/AXWGameboy/)

This is a work-in-progress gameboy emulator written in golang. So far most of the regular gameboy features are implemented. CGB support is mostly done with a few bugs still existing.

It should be compatible (with some additional work) to macOS, FreeBSD, iOS, WebAssembly and Nintendo Switchâ„¢ thanks to cross plattform support by [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) and GoMobile. For compilation support please refer to those projects first. Main target plattform is webassembly.

# Try it online

A copy of the emulator running in your browser is available [here](https://arcticxwolf.github.io/AXWGameboy/).

# Compilation

You might need to install some build dependencies. These are required by ebiten as our game engine. For further instructions (and install help for each OS) please refer to the ebiten documentation.

Afterwards you can build the bootroms with `make bootroms` and then use `make all` to build the emulator + start a webserver serving it on localhost:8008.
